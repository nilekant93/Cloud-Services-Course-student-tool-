## Overview
Cloud Services Course **Student Tool** is a web-based application for students.  
It allows students to **verify the deployment of their assignments** by providing a URL.  
The application runs automated tests against the submitted URL and returns either a **"passed"** or **"failed"** result.  
Students can also track their **weekly progress** throughout the course.
